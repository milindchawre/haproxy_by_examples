# Sticky sessions in haproxy

**Sticky Sessions**: The problem with using a load balancer is that by default, traffic bounces from one server to the next. Some applications require that a user continues to connect to the same backend server. This persistence is achieved through sticky sessions.

#### Pre-requisite
- A Virtual Machine(VM) running any OS centos, ubuntu, etc.
- [Docker] installed on the VM.
- Ports 7979-8082 opened in the security group.

#### Steps to enable sticky sessions in HAProxy
- First we create docker image for our 2 apache webserver using these commands.
```sh
docker build -t apache1 -f Dockerfile1 .
docker build -t apache2 -f Dockerfile2 .
```
- Now we create docker image for HAProxy.
```sh
docker build -t haproxy:sticky -f Dockerfile3 .
```
- Now we run our apache webserver.
```sh
docker run -d -it -p 8081:80 apache1
docker run -d -it -p 8082:80 apache2
```
- Verify the webserver is running by hitting this URL in browser. URLs `http://<machine-ip>:8081` and `http://<machine-ip>:8082` The browser should show `server-1` or `server-2` as an output.
- Now run HAProxy.
```sh
docker run -d -it -e machine_ip=<ip-of-machine> -p 7979:7979 -p 8080:80 haproxy:sticky
```
- Now hit port 8080 where HAProxy is load balancing the webservers. URL `http://<machine-ip>:8080`. The browser should now output either `server-1` and `server-2` and stick to that server. In my case its sticking to `server-2`.

#### How it works
- The sticky sessions is achieved by the following configuration in haproxy.cfg file
```sh
backend apache_backend
   balance roundrobin
   cookie SERVERID insert indirect nocache
   server web1 ${machine_ip}:8081 check cookie w1
   server web2 ${machine_ip}:8082 check cookie w2
```
- the line `cookie SERVERID insert indirect nocache` tells HAProxy to setup a cookie called SERVERID only if the user did not come with such cookie. It is going to append a "Cache-Control: nocache" as well, since this type of traffic is supposed to be personnal and we donâ€™t want any shared cache on the internet to cache it.
- the statement `cookie xx` on the server line definition provides the value of the cookie inserted by HAProxy. When the client comes back, then HAProxy knows directly which server to choose for this client.
